### Data Cleaning

- create target variable (can you do EDA on the entire data set but only model on a subset?)
- examine null values (eliminate?)
    - classes put -7 as 0
    - rename "are you taking a class" to "not taking a class" or create a new column using -7 from previous
    
- dummy variables

### EDA

- demographic breakdown (race, gender, school type)
- above with groupby yes/no STEM
